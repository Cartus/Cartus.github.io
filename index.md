## About

I am a 3th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at SUTD, working with Prof. [Wei Lu]. Currently(https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei), I am in ILCC at the University of Edinburgh, working with Prof. [Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/), Prof. [Giorgio Satta](http://www.dei.unipd.it/~satta/), Prof. [Frank Drewes](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/frank-drewes/) and Prof. [Johanna Bj√∂rklund](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/johanna-bjorklund/). I am most interested in structures from text. How to predict the structures and apply them to different tasks.
