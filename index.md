## About

I am a 3th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at SUTD, working with Prof. Wei Lu. Currently, I am in ILCC at the University of Edinburgh, working with Prof. Shay Cohen, Prof. Giorgio Satta, Prof. Frank Drewes and Prof. Johanna Björklund. I am most interested in structures from text. How to predict the structures and apply them to different tasks.
